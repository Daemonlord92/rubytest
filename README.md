# Now, Soon, Later

Need some help with this project.
I'm trying to create a loop that allows the user
to continue to add as many entries as they like
into a specified array and have the program store
the new entries into the array consecutively.

For some reason my while loop is not restarting
when the user chooses to add another entry and
the program continues to the next line and prompts 
"Would you like to view your tasks?"

Not sure where I'm going wrong here. Would appreciate
some guidance on this. Thanks in advance - Z
